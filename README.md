> A Markdown/MultiMarkdown/Pandoc HTML output CSS stylesheet

General style is clean, with minimal re-definition of the defaults or overrides of user font settings. The body text and header styles are left alone except title, author and date classes are centered. A Pandoc TOC is not printed, URLs are printed after hyperlinks in parentheses. Block quotes are italicized. Tables are lightly styled with lines above and below the table and below the header with a boldface header. Code blocks are line wrapped. 

All elements that Pandoc and MultiMarkdown use should be listed here, even if the style is empty so you can easily add styling to anything.

There are some elements in here for HTML5 output of Pandoc, but I have not gotten around to testing that yet.
